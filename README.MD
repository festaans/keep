![Keep UI Reference](https://raw.github.com/festaans/keep/master/screenshot.png)
#### Round 1
Create a separate view and link to it from the overview (root) view and implement the design above using the data provided.

- Using the git workflow create a branch per feature and open a pull request once that feature is complete - upon successful review (+1) you can merge the feature branch into master.

Your score will be the total of the following:

- plus 10 for using SASS variables
- plus 20 for using SASS Mixins
- plus 10 for using any other SASS features
- plus 30 for including ARIA tags
- plus 50 for being responsive (tablet - 768 & mobile - 320)
- plus 10 for effectively using FlexBox
- plus 1 for every merged pull request
- minus the div-percentage between your implementation and the screenshot above (test will be run @1150x800)

#### Round 2
As a team create a fully functional, fully tested, responsive, pixel perfect version of Keep. This version of Keep should store items using local storage.

You will be scored using the following criteria:
- Your use of git flow
- Project structure (Seperation of concerns into separate files)
- The extend to which you tested your code
